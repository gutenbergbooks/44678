<h1><i>THE PENITENTE MORADAS OF ABIQUIÚ</i></h1>

<p class="nodent"><i>By the early 19th century, Spanish-speaking residents of villages
in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado felt the need for a
brotherhood that would preserve their traditional social and religious
beliefs. Known as "brothers of light," or </i>penitentes<i>, these
Spanish-Americans centered their activities in a houselike building,
or </i>morada<i>, especially equipped for Holy Week ceremonies.</i></p>

<p><i>For the first time, two intact </i>moradas<i> have been fully
photographed and described through the cooperation of the
</i>penitente<i> brothers of Abiquiú, New Mexico.</i></p>

<h2><i>Introduction</i></h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">This study describes</span> two
earthern buildings and their special furnishings&mdash;humble but unique
documents of Spanish-American culture. The two structures are located
in Abiquiú, a rural, Spanish-speaking village in northern New Mexico.
Known locally as <i>moradas</i>, they serve as meeting houses for
members of a flagellant brotherhood, the <i>penitentes</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>penitente</i> brotherhood is characteristic of Spanish culture
in New Mexico (herein called <i>Hispano</i> to indicate its derivation
from Hispanic traditions in Mexico). Although penitential activities
occurred in
Spain's former colonies&mdash;Mexico, Argentina, and the
Philippines&mdash;the <i>penitentes</i> in the mountainous region
that extends north of Albuquerque into southern Colorado
are remarkable for their persistence.</p>

<p>After a century and a half of clerical criticism<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span> and
extracultural pressures against the movement, physical
evidence of <i>penitente</i> activity, although scattered
and diminished, still survives. As intact, functioning
artifacts, the <i>penitente moradas</i> at Abiquiú are valuable
records of an autonomous, socio-religious brotherhood
and of its place in the troubled history of
Spanish-American culture in the Southwest.</p>

<p>This paper maintains that <i>penitentes</i> are not culturally deviant
or aberrant but comprise a movement based firmly in Hispanic
traditions as shown by their architecture and equipment found at
Abiquiú and by previously established religious and social practices.
Also, this paper presents in print for the first time a complete,
integrated, and functioning group of <i>penitente</i> artifacts
documented, in situ, by photographs.</p>

<p>My indebtedness in this study to local residents is immense: first,
for inspiration, from Rosenaldo Salazar of Hernández and his son
Regino, who introduced me to <i>penitente</i> members at Abiquiú and
four times accompanied me to the <i>moradas</i>. The singular
opportunity to measure and to photograph interiors and individual
artifacts is due wholly to the understandably wary but proud,
<i>penitentes</i> themselves. The task of identifying religious images
in the <i>moradas</i> was expertly done by E. Boyd, Curator of the
Spanish-Colonial Department in the Museum of New Mexico at Santa Fe.
The final responsibility for accuracy and interpretation of data, of
course, is mine alone.</p>

Beginning in 1820 with the report of ecclesiastic visitor Niño de
Guevara, the Catholic Church has continued to frown upon
<i>penitente</i> activities, A modern critical study by a churchman:
<span class="smcap">Father Angélico Chavez</span>, "The Penitentes of New Mexico,"
<i>New Mexico Historical Review</i> (April 1954), vol. 22, pp. 97-123.</p>

</div>

<h2><i>Penitente Organization</i></h2>

<p class="nodent"><i>Penitente</i> brotherhoods usually are made up of Spanish-speaking
Catholic laymen in rural communities. Although the activities and
artifacts vary in specific details, the basic structure, ceremonies,
and aims of <i>penitentes</i> as a cultural institution may be
generalized. Full membership is open only to adult males. Female
relatives may serve <i>penitente</i> chapters as auxiliaries who
clean, cook, and join in prayer, as do children on occasion, but men
hold all offices and make up the membership-at-large.</p>

<p><i>Penitente</i> membership comprises two strata distinguishable by
title and activity. In his study of <i>Hispano</i> institutional
values, Monro Edmonson notes that <i>penitente</i> chapters are
divided into these two groups: (1) common members or brothers in
discipline, <i>hermanos disciplantes</i>; and (2) officers, called
brothers of light, <i>hermanos de luz</i>.</p>

<p>Edmonson names each officer and lists his duties:</p>

<p class="block">The head of the chapter is the <i>hermano mayor</i>. He is assisted
in administrative duties by the warden (<i>celador</i>) and the
collector (<i>mandatario</i>), and in ceremonial duties by an
assistant (<i>coadjutor</i>), reader (<i>secretario</i>),
blood-letter (<i>sangredor</i>) and flutist (<i>pitero</i>). An
official called the nurse (<i>enfermero</i>) attends the flagellants,
and a master of novices (<i>maestro de novios</i>) supervises the
training of new members.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>In an early and apparently biased account of the <i>penitentes</i>,
Reverend Alexandar Darley,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
a Presbyterian missionary in southern
Colorado, provides additional terms for three officers: <i>picador</i>
(the blood-letter), <i>regador</i> or <i>rezador</i> (a tenth officer,
who led prayers) and <i>mayordomo de la muerte</i> (literally "steward
of death"). As host for meetings between <i>penitente</i> chapters,
the <i>mayordomo</i> may be a late 19th-century innovation that bears
the political overtones of a local leader.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Having less influence than individual officers are the
<i>penitente</i> members-at-large, numbering between thirty and fifty
in each chapter. Through the <i>Hispano</i> family system of extended
bilateral kinship, however, much of the village population is
represented in each local <i>penitente</i> group.</p>

<p>Edmonson's study in the Rimrock district demonstrates the deep sense
of social responsibility felt by <i>penitentes</i> for members and
their extended family circles. "Special assistants were appointed from
time to time to visit the sick or perform other community services
which the brotherhood may undertake."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>
At other times of need,
especially in sickness and death, the general <i>penitente</i>
membership renders invaluable service to the afflicted family. In
addition, <i>penitente</i> welfare efforts include spiritual as well
as physical comfort such as wakes, prayers and rosaries, and the
singing of funereal chants (<i>alabados</i>). At Española in November
of 1965, I witnessed <i>penitentes</i> contributing such help to
respected nonmembers: grave digging, financial aid, and a rosary
service with <i>alabados</i>.</p>

<p>These spiritual services, however, are peripheral to the principal
religious activity of <i>penitentes</i>&mdash;the Lenten observance of the
Passion and death of Jesus. During Holy Week, prayer meetings,
rosaries, and <i>via crucis</i> processions with religious images are
held at the <i>morada</i> and at a site representing Calvary
(<i>calvario</i>), usually the local cemetery. On Good Friday, vigils
are kept and the <i>morada</i> is darkened for a service known as
<i>las tinieblas</i>. The ceremony of "the darkenings" consists of
silent prayer broken by violent noise making. Metal sheets and chains,
wooden blocks and rattles are manipulated to suggest natural
disturbances at the moment of Jesus' death on the cross. This emphatic
portrayal of His last hours is recalled also by acts of contrition and
flagellation in <i>penitente</i> initiation rites, punishments, and
Holy Week processions.</p>

<p><i>Penitentes</i> use physical discipline and mortification as a
dramatic means to intensify their imitation of Jesus' suffering.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span>
Heavy timber crosses (<i>maderos</i>) and cactus whips
(<i>disciplinas</i>) are used in processions that often include a
figure of death in a cart (<i>la carreta de la muerte</i>).
Disciplinary and initiatory mortification in the <i>morada</i> makes
use of flint or glass blood-letting devices (<i>padernales</i>).<span

<h2><i>Origins of the Penitente Movement</i></h2>

<p class="nodent">By 1833, bodily penance practiced in lay brotherhoods of
<i>Hispano</i> Catholics attracted criticism from the Church in New
Mexico and resulted in the pejorative name <i>penitentes</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span>
Historically, however, within the traditional framework of Hispanic
Catholicism, the <i>penitentes</i> had precedents for their religious
practices, including flagellation.</p>

<p><i>Penitente</i> rites were derived from Catholic services already
common in colonial New Mexico. Prayers and rosaries said before altars
comprised an important part of <i>Hispano</i> religious observances,
and processions of Catholics and <i>penitentes</i> alike were
announced by bell, drum, and rifle in <i>Hispano</i> villages. In
particular,
<i>penitentes</i> used <i>via crucis</i> processions to dramatize the
Passion, portrayed in every Catholic church by the
fourteen Stations of the Cross. <i>Penitentes</i> also maintained
Catholic Lenten practices by holding <i>tenebrae</i>
services, the <i>tinieblas</i> rites mentioned above, and by
flagellation.</p>

<p>These parallels between Catholic and <i>penitente</i> religious
observances caused Edmonson to theorize that "the autonomous movement
originated within the Church."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span>
Variations, however, between the two
religious traditions led Edmonson to discover "an important thread of
religious independence and even apostasy in New Mexican history."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span>
Edmonson's study of 1950 has established the persistence of
<i>penitente</i> activity in <i>Hispano</i> culture.</p>

<p>Three and a half centuries earlier, in 1598, Spanish settlers made a
courageous thrust into the inhospitable environment of New Mexico.
Through the 17th and 18th centuries, Spanish settlement along the
upper Rio Grande was a tenuous thread unraveled from a stronger fabric
in Mexico. Aridity and extremes in temperatures marked New Mexico's
climate. Arable land was scarce and could be extended back from
streams only by careful upkeep of the irrigation ditches. Plateaus
rose from 1500 to more than 2500 meters in altitude. Building timbers
were hard to obtain without roads or navigable rivers.</p>

<p>Finally, distance itself was a challenge, sometimes insurmountable for
the supply caravans from Mexico. Outfitted over a thousand miles to
the south of Santa Fe, the Mexican caravans brought <i>presidio</i>
and mission supplies, but few goods for the common settler. By the end
of the 18th century, Spanish authorities thought of the northern
colonies (<i>provincias internas</i>) primarily as missionary fields
and military buffer zones.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Cultural traditions and an insecure environment caused Spanish
colonists to turn to religion for comfort. Again, however, a supply
problem arose. Individual <i>ranchos</i> were too scattered for
clerical visits, and even settlements that were grouped for greater
security, <i>poblaciones</i> or <i>plazas</i>, became <i>visitas</i>
on little
more than an annual basis, sharing two dozen Franciscan
clergy with missions assigned to Indian <i>pueblos</i>
and Spanish villages. Before 1800, a shortage of friars
prompted the Bishop in Durango to send secular clergy
into the Franciscan enclave of New Mexico. In 1821
the Mexican Revolution formalized secularization with
a new constitution. In brief, the traditional religious
patterns of the <i>Hispanos</i> were threatened. They needed
reinforcement if they were to survive.</p>

<p>By 1850, other conditions in New Mexico endangered the status quo of
the Spanish-speaking residents. With the growing dominance of
Anglo-Americans in the commercial, military, political, and social
matters of Santa Fe, <i>Hispanos</i> recognized the threat of Anglo
culture to their own traditional way of life. This cultural challenge
turned many <i>Hispanos</i> back in upon themselves for physical and
social security and for spiritual comfort. By the second quarter of
the 19th century, <i>penitentes</i> were common in <i>Hispano</i>
villages such as Abiquiú.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>
The immediate origins of penitentism
were clearly present in early 19th-century New Mexico.</p>

<p>Despite this evidence, historians of the Spanish Southwest have
suggested geographically and culturally remote sources for the
<i>penitentes</i>. Dorothy Woodward has pointed out similarities
between New Mexican <i>penitentes</i> and Spanish brotherhoods
(<i>cofradías</i>) of laymen.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span>
<i>Cofradías</i> were not full
church orders like the Franciscan Third Order, but they did conduct
Lenten processions with flagellation.</p>

<p>Somewhat nearer in miles but culturally more distant from <i>Hispano
penitente</i> experience was mortification practiced by Indians in New
Spain. In the 16th century, Spanish chroniclers reported incidents
ranging from sanguinary ceremonies of central Mexican tribes to
whippings witnessed in the northern provinces of Sonora and New
Mexico. While of peripheral interest to this study, these activities
of American Indians had no direct bearing on <i>Hispano</i> cultural
needs in early 19th-century New Mexico.</p>

<p>It is more significant that <i>Hispanos</i> already knew a lay
religious institution that very easily could have served as a model
for the <i>penitente</i> brotherhood&mdash;the Third Order of St. Francis.
Established in 13th-century Italy and carried to Spain by the Gray
Friars, the Order is recorded in contemporary histories of New
Mexico before 1700. Materials in the archives of the
Archdiocese of Santa Fe also document the presence
of the Franciscan Third Order in New Mexico and
suggest to me its influence on <i>penitente</i> activity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In March 1776, Fray Domínguez, an ecclesiastic visitor, recorded
Lenten "exercises" of the Third Order under the supervision of the
resident priest at Santa Cruz and, two weeks later, in April,
Domínguez visited Abiquiú, where he commended the Franciscan friar,
Fray Sebastian Angel Fernández, for "feasts of Our Lady, rosary with
the father in church. Fridays of Lent, <i>Via Crucis</i> with the
father, and later, after dark, discipline attended by those who came
voluntarily."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span>
Domínguez, however, described the priest as "not at
all obedient to rule"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span>
when Father Fernández, acting in an
independent manner, proceeded to build missions at Picuris and Sandia
without authorization. But in 1777, he again praised Fray Fernández
for special <i>Via Crucis</i> devotions and "scourging by the resident
missionary and some of the faithful."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span>
Domínguez thus documented
flagellant practices and <i>tinieblas</i> services at Abiquiú and his
approval, as an official Church representative, of these activities.</p>

<p>Father Chavez, O.F.M., protests the theory of <i>penitente</i> origins
in the Third Order of St. Francis and counters with the idea that
"penitentism" was imported directly from Mexico in the early
1800s.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span>
I note, however, that the bishops seated in Santa Fe after
1848 recognized the strength of this lay socio-religious movement and
tried to deal with it in terms of the Order. At a synod in 1888,
Archbishop Salpointe pleaded for <i>penitentes</i> "to return" to the
Third Order. Some degree of direct influence of the Third Order on
"penitentism" seems fairly certain.</p>

<p class="nodent">About three generations before the first <i>morada</i> was built at
Abiquiú, the conditions of settlement mentioned earlier and subsequent
historical events resulted in an environment conducive to the
development of
<i>penitente</i> activity. Shortly after 1740, civil authorities
in Santa Fe attempted to settle colonists along the
Chama River in order to create a buffer zone between
marauding Indians to the northwest and Spanish and
Pueblo villages on the Rio Grande (Figure 1). This
constant threat of annihilation produced self-reliant
and independent-minded settlers.</p>

<p>Unorthodoxy appeared early in the religious history of Abiquiú. By
1744, settlers had installed Santa Rosa de Lima as their patroness in
a little riverside plaza near modern Abiquiú. After a decade, several
colonists from Santa Rosa were moved to the hilltop plaza of Abiquiú,
where the mission of Santo Tomás Apostol had been established. In his
1776 visit to Abiquiú, Domínguez noted, however, a continuing
allegiance to the earlier patroness: "... settlers use the name of
Santa Rosa, as the lost mission was called in the old days. Therefore,
they celebrate the feast of this female saint [August 30th] and not of
that masculine saint [St. Thomas the Apostle, December 21]."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span>
Loyalty to Saint Rose survived this official protest, and village
festivals have persisted in honoring Santa Rosa to this day. It is,
therefore, not surprising to find her image in the earlier east
<i>morada</i> of Abiquiú.</p>

<p>A disturbing influence in the religious life of Abiquiú were
semi-Christianized servants <i>(genízaros)</i>, who had been ransomed
from the Indians by Spaniards.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span>
Often used to establish frontier
settlements, <i>genízaros</i> came to be a threat to the cultural
stability of Abiquiú. For example, in 1762, two <i>genízaros</i>
accused of witchcraft were taken to Santa Cruz for judicial action.
After the trial, Governor Cachupín sent a detachment from Santa Fe to
Abiquiú to destroy an inscribed stone said to be a relic of black
magic.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span>
Similar incidents with <i>genízaros</i> during the next
generation prolonged the unstable religious pattern at Abiquiú. In
1766, an Indian girl accused a <i>genízaro</i> couple of killing the
resident priest, Fray Felix Ordoñez y Machado, by witchcraft.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span>
And again in 1782 and 1786, charges of apostasy were entered against
Abiquiú <i>genízaros</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Another disturbing element in the religious history of Abiquiú was the
disinterest of her settlers in the
building and furnishing of Santo Tomás Mission. Although
the structure was completed in the first generation
of settlement at Abiquiú, 1755 to 1776, Domínguez
could report only two contributions from colonists, both
loans: "In this room [sacristy] there is an ordinary table
with a drawer and key ... a loan from a settler called
Juan Pablo Martin ... the chalice is in three pieces,
and one of them, for it is a loan by the settlers, is used
for a little shrine they have."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span>
All mission equipment
was supplied by royal funds (<i>sínodos</i>) except some
religious articles provided by the resident missionary,
Fray Fernández, who finished the structure raised half
way by his predecessor, Fray Juan José Toledo. Both
Franciscans found settlers busy with everyday problems
of survival and resentful when called on to labor
for the mission. The settlers not only failed to supply
any objects, but when they were required to work at
the mission, all tools and equipment had to be supplied
to them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite these detrimental influences, the mission at Abiquiú continued
to grow. Between 1760 and 1793, the population increased from 733 to
1,363, making Abiquiú the third largest settlement in colonial New
Mexico north of Paso del Norte [Ciudad Juarez].<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span>
(Only Santa Cruz with 1,650 and Santa Fe with 2,419 persons were larger.) In 1795, the
pueblo had maintained its size at 1,558, with Indians representing
less than 10 percent of the population.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The increase in size brought the mission at Abiquiú more important and
longer-term resident missionaries: Fathers José de la Prada, from 1789
to 1806, and Teodoro Alcina de la Borda, from 1806 to 1823. Both men
were elected directors (<i>custoses</i>) of the Franciscan mission
field in New Mexico, "The Custody of the Conversion of St. Paul."
<i>Custoses</i> Prada and Borda backed the Franciscans, who were
fighting for a missionary field that they had long considered their
own. Official directives (<i>patentes</i>) issued by <i>Custos</i>
Prada at Abiquiú warned all settlers against "new ideas of liberty"
and asked each friar for his personal concept of governmental
rights.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span>
In 1802, Fray Prada also complained to the new
<i>Custos</i>, Father Sanchez Vergara, about missions that had been
neglected under the secular clergy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span>
In this period, Abiquiú's mission
was a center of clerical reaction to the revolutionary
political ideas and clerical secularization that had resulted
from Mexico's recent independence from Spain.</p>

<p>In the year 1820, the strained relations between religious authorities
and the laity at Abiquiú clearly reflected the unstable conditions in
New Mexico. Eventually, charges of manipulating mission funds and
neglect of clerical duties were brought against Father Alcina de la
Borda by the citizens of Abiquiú.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span>
At the same time, Governor
Melgares informed the <i>Alcalde Mayor</i>, Santiago Salazar, that
these funds (<i>sínodos</i>) had been reduced and that an oath of
loyalty to the Spanish crown would be required.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span>
This situation produced a strong reaction in Abiquiú's next generation, which sought
to preserve its traditional cultural patterns in the <i>penitente</i>
brotherhoods.</p>

<p>The great-grandsons of Abiquiú's first settlers witnessed a
significant change in organization of their mission&mdash;its
secularization in 1826. For three years, Father Borda had shared his
mission duties with Franciscans from San Juan and Santa Clara
<i>pueblos</i>, giving way in 1823 to the last member of the Order to
serve Santo Tomás, Fray Sanchez Vergara. Santo Tomás Mission received
its first secular priest in 1823, Cura Leyva y Rosas, who returned to
Abiquiú in 1832. Officially the mission at Abiquiú was secularized in
1826, along with those at Belén and Taos.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_32" id="Ref_32" href="#Foot_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The first secular priest assigned to Santo Tomás reflected the now
traditional and self-sufficient character of <i>Hispano</i> culture at
Abiquiú.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_33" id="Ref_33" href="#Foot_33">[33]</a></span>
He was the independent-minded Don Antonio José Martínez.
Born in Abiquiú, Don Antonio later became an ambitious spiritual and
political leader in Taos, where he fought to preserve traditional
<i>Hispano</i> culture from Anglo-American influences.</p>

<p>The mission served by Father Martínez in Taos bore resemblance to that
at Abiquiú. Both missions rested on much earlier Indian settlements,
but the Taos pueblo was still active. Furthermore, Taos and Abiquiú
were buffer settlements on the frontier, where Indian raids as well as
trade occurred. In 1827 a census by P. B. Pino listed nearly 3,600
persons at
Taos and a similar count at Abiquiú; only Santa Fe
with 5,700 and Santa Cruz with 6,500 were larger
villages.</p>

<p>At this time, an independent element appeared in the religious
activities of the Santa Cruz region. In 1831, Vicar Rascon gave
permission to sixty members of the Third Order of St. Francis at Santa
Cruz to hold Lenten exercises in Taos, provided that no "abuses" arose
to be corrected on his next visit.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_34" id="Ref_34" href="#Foot_34">[34]</a></span>
Apparently this warning proved
inadequate, for in 1833 Archbishop Zubiría concluded his visitation at
Santa Cruz by ordering that "pastors of this villa ... must never in
the future permit such reunions of <i>Penitentes</i> under any pretext
whatsoever."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_35" id="Ref_35" href="#Foot_35">[35]</a></span>
We have noted, however, that two generations earlier
Fray Domínguez had commended similar observances at Santa Cruz and
Abiquiú, and it was not until the visitation of Fray Niño de Guevara,
1817-1820, that Church officials found it necessary to condemn
penitential activity in New Mexico.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_36" id="Ref_36" href="#Foot_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>In little more than two generations, from 1776 to 1833, the Franciscan
missions were disrupted by secularization and excessive acts of
penance. In the second half of the 19th century, the new, non-Spanish
Archbishops, Lamy and Salpointe, saw a relation between the Franciscan
Third Order and the brotherhood of <i>penitentes</i>. When J. B. Lamy
began signing rule books (<i>arreglos</i>) for the <i>penitente</i>
chapters of New Mexico,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_37" id="Ref_37" href="#Foot_37">[37]</a></span>
he hoped to reintegrate them into accepted
Church practice as members of the Third Order. And at the end of the
century, J. B. Salpointe expressed his belief that the
<i>penitente</i> brotherhood had been an outgrowth of the Franciscan
tertiaries.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_38" id="Ref_38" href="#Foot_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Abiquiú shared in events that marked the religious history of New
Mexico in the last three quarters of the 19th century. We have noted
the secularization of Santo Tomás Mission in 1826; by 1856 the village
had its <i>penitente</i> rule book duly signed by Archbishop Lamy.
Entitled <i>Arreglo de la Santa Hermandad de la Sangre de Nuestro
Señor Jesucristo</i>, a copy was signed by Abiquiú's priest, Don Pedro
Bernal, on April 6, 1867.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_39" id="Ref_39" href="#Foot_39">[39]</a></span>
While officialdom worked out new religious and political
relations, villagers struggled to preserve a more
familiar tradition.</p>

<p>Occupation of New Mexico in 1846 by United States troops tended to
solidify traditional <i>Hispano</i> life in Abiquiú. In that year,
Navajo harassments caused an encampment of 180 men under Major Gilpin
to be stationed at Abiquiú.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_40" id="Ref_40" href="#Foot_40">[40]</a></span>
Eventually, the Indian raids
slackened, and a trading post for the Utes was set up at Abiquiú in
1853.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_41" id="Ref_41" href="#Foot_41">[41]</a></span>
Neither the U.S. Army nor Indian trading posts, however,
became integrated into Abiquiú's <i>Hispano</i> way of life, and these
extracultural influences soon moved on, leaving only a few commercial
artifacts.</p>

<p>With a new generation of inhabitants occupying Abiquiú between 1864
and 1886, the village on the Rio Chama lost its primary function as a
buffer settlement against nomadic Indians and settled down into a
well-established cultural pattern, which in part was preserved by the
<i>penitentes</i>. Kit Carson had rounded up the Navajos at Bosque
Redondo, and two decades later, by 1883, the Utes had been moved
north. In preparation, the Indian trading post at Abiquiú was closed
in 1872 and moved to the new seat of Rio Arriba County, Tierra
Amarilla,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_42" id="Ref_42" href="#Foot_42">[42]</a></span>
65 kilometers northward. Within two generations,
Abiquiú's population had fallen to fewer than 800 from a high of
nearly 3,600 in 1827.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_43" id="Ref_43" href="#Foot_43">[43]</a></span>
As a result, many <i>Hispanos</i> at Abiquiú
withdrew into the <i>penitente</i> organization, which promised to
preserve and even intensify their traditional ways of life and
beliefs. These attitudes were materialized in the building of the
<i>penitente moradas</i>.</p>

<h2><i>The Architecture of the Moradas</i></h2>

<div class="image-left" style="max-width: 195px;">

    <p><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>
    The Abiquiú area, showing the Chama River, U.S. Highway 84, and
    siting of buildings (the mission of Santo Tomás and the two
    <i>moradas</i> are circled).</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">In a modern map (Figure 2), circles enclose the Mission of Abiquiú and
its two <i>penitente moradas</i>. The <i>moradas</i> lie 300 meters
east and 400 meters south of the main plaza onto which Santo Tomás
Mission faces from the north. Between the <i>moradas</i> rests the
local burial ground (<i>campo santo</i>), a cemetery that serves
<i>penitentes</i> as "Calvary" (<i>calvario</i>) in their Lenten
re-enactment of the Passion.</p>

<p><i>Penitente moradas</i> share a common system of <i>adobe</i>
construction with the religious and domestic structures of New Mexico.
While the Indians set walls of puddled earth directly on the ground,
the Spaniards, following Moorish precedent, laid <i>adobe</i> bricks
on stone foundations. Standard house-size <i>adobes</i> average 15 by
30 by 50 centimeters. <i>Adobe</i> bricks are made by packing a
mixture of mud, sand, and straw into a wood frame from which the block
then is knocked out onto the ground to dry in the sun. Stones set in
<i>adobe</i> mortar provide a foundation. The sun-dried bricks, which
are also laid in <i>adobe</i> mortar, form exterior, load-bearing
walls and interior partitions.</p>

<p>Spanish <i>adobe</i> construction also employs wood. Openings are
framed and closed with a lintel that
projects well into the wall. These recessed lintel faces
often are left exposed after the plastering of adjoining
surfaces. Roofs are transverse beams (<i>vigas</i>), which
in turn hold small cross branches (<i>savinos</i>) or planks
(<i>tablas</i>). A final layer of brush and <i>adobe</i> plaster closes
the surface cracks. Plank drains (<i>canales</i>), rectangular
in section, lead water from this soft roof surface (Figure 3).</p>

<p>Domestic <i>adobe</i> structures differ from ecclesiastic buildings in
scale and in spatial arrangement. Colonial New Mexican churches are
relatively large, unicellular spaces. Their simple nave volume often
is made cruciform by a transept whose higher roof allows for a
clerestory. A choir loft over the entry and a narrowed, elevated
sanctuary further articulate the space at each end of the nave. In
contrast, <i>Hispano</i> houses consist of several low rooms set in a
line or grouped around a court (<i>placita</i>) in which a gate and
porch (<i>portal</i>) are placed. Rooms vary in width according to the
length of the transverse beams, which usually are from four to six
meters long.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_44" id="Ref_44" href="#Foot_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The everyday living spaces inside Spanish-New Mexican houses tend to
combine domestic activities and to appear similar in space and decor.
Inside a <i>Hispano</i> church, however, areas of special useage are
marked off clearly within the volume. Celebration of the mass requires
a special spatial treatment to indicate the sanctuary. This area is
emphasized by an arched entry, lateral pilasters, raised floor, and
characteristically convergent side walls. These slanting walls provide
better vision for the congregation and easier movement for the
celebrants. The convergent wall of sanctuaries is often visible from
the exterior. It is noteworthy that both the contracted sanctuary of
local churches and the linear arrangement of domestic interiors appear
in the <i>penitente moradas</i> of Abiquiú.</p>

<p>In the plans of the Abiquiú <i>moradas</i> (Figure 4), the identical
arrangement of the three rooms reveals an origin in the typical
<i>Hispano</i> house form. George Kubler has observed that the design
of <i>moradas</i> "is closer to the domestic architecture of New
Mexico than to the churches."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_45" id="Ref_45" href="#Foot_45">[45]</a></span>
Bainbridge Bunting confirms the
houselike form of <i>moradas</i> but notes their lack of
uniformity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_46" id="Ref_46" href="#Foot_46">[46]</a></span>
In comparison to <i>moradas</i> of the L-plan,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_47" id="Ref_47" href="#Foot_47">[47]</a></span>
and
even of the pre-1856 T-plan structure at Arroyo Hondo,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_48" id="Ref_48" href="#Foot_48">[48]</a></span>
the two <i>penitente</i> buildings at Abiquiú preserve a simple | shape with
one significant variation&mdash;a contracted chancel.</p>

<p>The basic form of the Abiquiú <i>moradas</i> (Figures 5 and 6) is a
rectangular box that closely resembles nearby houses. Even the long,
windowless north facade of both Abiquiú <i>moradas</i> recalls the
unbroken walls of earlier <i>Hispano</i> houses in hostile frontier
regions. The Abiquiú <i>moradas</i>, however, possess one exception to
the domestic form&mdash;a narrowed, accented end. On each <i>morada</i> the
west end is blunted and buttressed by a salient bell tower of stones
laid in <i>adobe</i> mortar and strengthened by horizontal boards
(Figures 7 and 8). This innovation in the form of the Abiquiú
<i>moradas</i> appears to be ecclesiastic in origin.</p>

<p>Plans of churches built close to Abiquiú in time, distance, and
orientation could have served as sources for the design of the
<i>moradas'</i> west ends (Figure 9). Only five kilometers east of
Abiquiú stood the chapel dedicated to Santa Rosa de Lima. As shown in
Figure 9<span class="smcap">f</span>, the sanctuary in its west end had
a raised floor and flanking entry pilasters, features found in the east
<i>morada's</i> west end. This chapel was dedicated about 1744 and was
still active as a <i>visíta</i> from Abiquiú in 1830.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_49" id="Ref_49" href="#Foot_49">[49]</a></span>
Through this period and to
the present, the popularity of Saint Rose of Lima has persisted at
Abiquiú. Her nearby chapel would have been a likely and logical choice
for the design of the <i>morada's</i> sanctuary end.</p>

    Santa Cruz; F, Santa Rosa; G, Ranchos de Taos; H, the

    E=9, F=34, G=13, H=22, I=35.)</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A second possible source for the contracted ends of the Abiquiú
<i>moradas</i> would be the south transept chapel of the Third Order
of St. Francis at Santa Cruz (Figure 9<span class="smcap">e</span>). It was completed
shortly before 1798<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_50" id="Ref_50" href="#Foot_50">[50]</a></span>
and served Franciscan tertiaries into the
1830s. Plans compared in Figure 9 indicate that the dimensions of this
left transept chapel at Santa Cruz measure only
five percent larger than the chapel room of the east
<i>morada</i> at Abiquiú, and the plans also reveal contracted
chancel walls at both locations.</p>

<p>The concept of a constricted sanctuary as seen in Abiquiú
<i>moradas</i> originated in earlier Spanish and Mexican churches. In
1479, architect Juan Guas used a trapezoidal apse plan in San Juan de
los Reyes at Toledo and, by 1512, the design found its way into
America's first cathedral at Santo Domingo. Within the first century
of Spanish colonization, contracted sanctuary walls appeared on the
American mainland in Arciniega's revised plan for Mexico City's
Cathedral (post-1584)<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_51" id="Ref_51" href="#Foot_51">[51]</a></span>
and, again, in New Mexico, where it first
appeared at the stone mission of Zía, built about 1614 (Figure 9<span class="smcap">c</span>).
Once established in the Franciscan province, the concept of converging
sanctuary walls survived the 1680 Indian revolt and returned with the
reconquest of New Mexico in 1693. Spaniards raised and rebuilt
missions from the capital at Santa Fe (San Miguel, rebuilt 1710;
Figure 9<span class="smcap">d</span>) north to Taos (San Geronimo, 1706). Throughout the
18th century, in a three-to-one ratio, the churches of New Mexico used
the contracted, as opposed to the box, sanctuary.</p>

<p>In the early 19th century, churches at Ranchos de Taos (1805-1815<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_52" id="Ref_52" href="#Foot_52">[52]</a></span>;
Figure 9<span class="smcap">g</span>), Chimayo (about 1810; Figure 9<span class="smcap">h</span>), and
Córdova (after 1830; Figure 9<span class="smcap">i</span>) continued to employ the trapezoidal
sanctuary form. By midcentury, <i>penitente</i> brotherhoods are known
to have been active in these villages, and the local ecclesiastic
structures could have acted as an influence in the design of the
<i>penitente moradas</i> at Abiquiú.</p>

<p>In summary, the <i>moradas</i> at Abiquiú are traditional regional
buildings in material and in basic form. The pointed west end of each
building, however, is an ecclesiastic innovation in an otherwise
typical domestic design. These <i>moradas</i> provide a significant
design variant in the history of Spanish-American architecture in New
Mexico.</p>

<h2><i>Interior Space and Artifacts</i></h2>

<p class="nodent">The plans of the two <i>penitente moradas</i> of Abiquiú (Figure 4)
reveal an identical arrangement of interior
space. There are three rooms in each <i>morada</i>: (1) the
longest is on the west end and, with its constricted
sanctuary space, acts as an oratory; (2) the center
room serves as a sacristy; and (3) the east room is for
storage. The only major difference between the two
<i>moradas</i> is the length of the storage room, which is
nearly twice as long in the east <i>morada</i>. The remarkable
similarities in design suggest that one served as the
model for the other; local oral tradition holds that the
east <i>morada</i> is older.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_53" id="Ref_53" href="#Foot_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Internal evidence indicates that the east <i>morada</i> is indeed the
older one. As shown in Figure 2, the south <i>morada</i> is located
farther from the Abiquiú <i>plaza</i>, suggesting it was built at a
later date&mdash;perhaps nearer 1900, when public and official criticism
had prompted greater privacy for Holy Week processions, which were
considered spectacles by tourists. In addition, the lesser width of
the south <i>morada</i> rooms, the square-milled beams in the oratory,
and the fireplace in the east end storage room indicate that it was
built after the east <i>morada</i>. In contrast, the two corner
fireplaces of the east <i>morada</i> are set in the center room, while
another heating arrangement&mdash;an oil drum set on a low <i>adobe</i>
dais&mdash;appears to have been added at a later date.</p>

<p>The east <i>morada</i> was the obvious model for the builders of the
later one on the south edge of Abiquiú. Local <i>penitentes</i> admit
that there was a division in the original chapter just prior to
1900<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_54" id="Ref_54" href="#Foot_54">[54]</a></span>
but deny that the separation was made because of political
differences, as suggested by one author.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_55" id="Ref_55" href="#Foot_55">[55]</a></span>
The older members say
that the first <i>morada</i> merely had become too large for
convenient use of the building.</p>

<p>The three rooms in each <i>morada</i> are distinguished by bare,
whitewashed walls of <i>adobe</i> plaster, hard-packed dirt floors,
two exterior doors, and three windows. A locked door is located off
the oratory in the north face of the south <i>morada</i>. Figures 10
and 11 show the sanctuaries in the south and east <i>morada</i>; and
Figure 12, the back of the east <i>morada</i> oratory. Its open door
leads into the center room, where the members would not remove the
boards on the windows for me to take photographs. The east end room in
each <i>morada</i>
serves for storage of processional and ceremonial equipment.</p>

<p>The storage room in the east <i>morada</i> also contains commercially
made lamps, such as the plated reservoir with stamped Neo-rococo
motifs (Figure 19). Nearby is a processional cross with two metal
faces and a small, cast corpus (Figure 20). While kerosene lanterns
are evidence of east-west rail commerce after 1880, the cross probably
indicates a southern contact, possibly through Parral or Chihuahua,
Mexico. Locally made, however, are the woven rag rugs (<i>jergas</i>)
hung over a pole (<i>varal</i>)<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_56" id="Ref_56" href="#Foot_56">[56]</a></span>
that drops from the ceiling. Also
in the east <i>morada</i> storage are two percussion rifles (Figure
21). Craddock Goins, Department of Armed Forces History, the
Smithsonian Institution, identifies both as common Indian trade
objects from midcentury Europe. These rifles probably were imports for
sale to the Utes at the Abiquiú trading post between 1853 and 1874. At
the rear of the room (Figure 22) rests a saw-horse table holding an
assortment of stocks for these "trade guns," of wooden rattles
(<i>matracas</i>), and of heavy crosses (<i>maderos</i>). On the
ground stands a large bell, which, in a photograph (Museum of New
Mexico, Photo No. 8550) taken by William Lippincott about 1945,
appears on the tower of the <i>morada</i>. The
silhouette dates the bell as being cast after 1760. Behind
the bell rests the <i>morada</i> death cart. Also in the
room are a plank ladder and the oil drum stove raised
on an <i>adobe</i> dais (Figure 23) to the east of the exterior
door.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><span class="smcap">Sacristy in Both Moradas.</span>&mdash;While a panelled wooden box in the
south <i>morada</i> stands inside the exterior door of the east room,
another type of chest, said to hold cooking utensils, rests in the
northwest corner of the center room of the east <i>morada</i>. Both
storage chests are located in rooms with corner fireplaces. An
informant said that these boxes held heating and cooking utensils and
ceremonial equipment, including the <i>penitentes'</i> rule book. As
noted above, the two fireplaces in the middle room of the east
<i>morada</i> suggest that it was built earlier than the south
<i>morada</i>, which has a single fireplace in the less active and
more convenient rear storage room. Further evidence of this point is
that the storage chest in the east <i>morada</i> is better constructed
than that in the south <i>morada</i>; the former displays a slanted
top and punch-decorated tin reinforcements on its corners. In the
center room there are several benches with lathe-turned legs (Figure
24).</p>

<p>The central room of the south <i>morada</i> also displays a number of
benches of an earlier style (Figure 25). Over the rear door appears an
unusual cross (Figure 26). The cross consists of two wood planks, 1.6
centimeters thick, notched together and covered with paper. The
surface bears carefully drawn, or perhaps stenciled, floral and
religious designs in indigo blue: eleven Latin crosses appear among
flowering vases, oversize buds, and 4-, 5-, and 8-pointed stars. These
motifs probably are the result of copying from weaving or quilt
pattern books of the late 19th century. A local <i>penitente</i>
leader stated that the cross was made before 1925 by Onésimo Martínez
of Abiquiú, when the latter was in his thirties. (The strong religious
symbolism of the New Mexican designs reminds one of the stylized
motifs on Atlantic Coastal folk drawings and textiles of Germanic
origin.)</p>

Domínguez.<span

<p>Before describing religious objects in the west end rooms of Abiquiú
<i>moradas</i>, a list of similar items in Santo Tomás Mission at an
earlier date (1776) is of interest:</p>

 <p class="block">a medium-sized bell ... altar table ... gradin ... altar cloth ... a
 banner ... candleholders ... processional cross ... a painted wooden
 cross ... ordinary single-leaved door ... image in the round of Our
 Lady of the [Immaculate] Conception ... a wig ... silver crown ...
 string of fine seed pearls ... ordinary bouquet ... painting on
 copper of Our Lady of Sorrows (<i>Dolores</i>) in a black frame ...
 <i>Via Crucis</i> in small paper prints on their little boards ... a
 print of the Guadalupe.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_58" id="Ref_58" href="#Foot_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Comparable versions of each of these objects occur in Abiquiú's
<i>moradas</i>. In fact, virtually all objects found in the
<i>penitente moradas</i> of Abiquiú are recorded as typical artifacts
by church inventories and house wills of 18th- and 19th-century
Spanish New Mexico.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_59" id="Ref_59" href="#Foot_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p class="gap-above"><span class="smcap">Oratory in the East Morada.</span>&mdash;In the rear of the oratory of
the older east <i>morada</i> (Figure 12), one sees a stove and lantern
on the right. Both are imported, extracultural items. The pierced, tin
candle-lantern (Figure 29) is a common artifact found throughout
Europe and America.<span

    <span class="smcap">Manufacture</span>: Pierced tinwork.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Along the walls of the oratory hang imported religious prints framed
in local punch-decorated tinwork. Tin handicraft became more
widespread after 1850 when metal U.S. Army containers became available
to the <i>Hispanos</i>. Designs seen on three tin frames (Figure 30)
include twisted columns, crests, scallops, corner blocks, wings, and a
variety of simple repoussé patterns. Paper prints in the tin frame
suggest midcentury trade contacts between northern Mexico and the
Atlantic Coast. Even the Mexican War (1846-1848) did not discourage
American publishers such as Currier from appealing to Mexican
religious and national loyalties with lithographs of Our Lady of
Guadalupe (much in the same manner as the British, after the
Revolution and War of 1812, profited by selling Americans objects that
bore images of Yankee ships, eagles, and likenesses of
Franklin and Washington). A fourth piece of local
tinwork (Figure 31) in the east <i>morada</i> oratory is a
niche for a small figure of the Holy Child of Atocha,
<i>Santo Niño de Atocha</i>. This advocation of Jesus, like
that of His mother in the Guadalupe image, further
indicates Mexican influence.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_61" id="Ref_61" href="#Foot_61">[61]</a></span>
The image of the
<i>Atocha</i> is a product of local craftsmanship.</p>

<p>These representations of religious personages are called
<i>santos</i>, and their makers, <i>santeros</i>. Flat panel paintings
are known locally as <i>retablos</i>, while sculptured forms are
<i>bultos</i>. George Kubler, distinguished art historian at Yale,
suggests that <i>bultos</i>, because of their greater dimensional
realism, are more popular than planar <i>retablos</i> with the
<i>Hispanos</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_62" id="Ref_62" href="#Foot_62">[62]</a></span>
Supporting this theory is the fact that
<i>bultos</i> in the Abiquiú <i>moradas</i> outnumber prints and
<i>retablos</i> two to one.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most distinctive three-dimensional image in any
<i>morada</i> is not a <i>santo</i> by definition, but a unique figure
that represents death (<i>la muerte</i>). Also known as <i>La Doña
Sebastiana</i>, her image clearly marks a building as a
<i>penitente</i> sanctuary. Personifying death with a sculptured image
and dragging her cart to a cemetery called <i>calvario</i>, the
<i>penitentes</i> of New Mexico reflect the sense of fate common to
Spanish-speaking cultures, the recognition that death is life's one
personal certainty.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_63" id="Ref_63" href="#Foot_63">[63]</a></span>
The figure of death in the east <i>morada</i>
hangs in the corner at the rear of the oratory. Placed outside for
examination, this <i>muerte</i> (Figure 32) presents a flat, oval face
with blank eyes. The black gown and bow and arrow are typical of
<i>muerte</i> figures.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_64" id="Ref_64" href="#Foot_64">[64]</a></span>
Turning toward the altar (Figure 11), one sees
that death is outnumbered by images of hope and compassion:
Jesus, His mother, and the saints who intercede
for man.</p>

<p>On the lower step of the altar appear a host of small, commercial
products, mostly crucifixes, in plaster, plastic, and cheap metal
alloys as well as numerous glass cups for candles. Above the upper
ledge (<i>gradin</i>) appear five locally made images of Jesus
crucified, <i>El Cristo</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_65" id="Ref_65" href="#Foot_65">[65]</a></span>
At the side of this central
<i>Cristo</i> (Figure 33) hangs a small angel, <i>angelito</i>, which
traditionally held a chalice to catch blood from the spear wound.
Other <i>Cristos</i>, at the Taylor Museum in Colorado Springs and at
the Museum of New Mexico (McCormick Collection A.7.49-24) in Santa Fe,
repeat the weightless corpus and stylized wounds used by the anonymous
<i>santero</i> who, after 1850, made these <i>bultos</i>.</p>

<p>To the far left stands an important image: the scourged Jesus (Figure 38)
prominent in <i>penitente</i> activity as "Our Father Jesus the
Nazarene" (<i>Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno</i>). By 1918, Alice Corbin
Henderson<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_66" id="Ref_66" href="#Foot_66">[66]</a></span>
reports, this same figure appeared in <i>penitente</i>
Holy Week processions at Abiquiú. She claims it was made originally
for the Mission of Santo Tomás. E. Boyd points out stylistic traits
shared by this Abiquiú <i>bulto</i> and the <i>retablo</i> figures in
the San José de Chama Chapel at nearby Hernández, which was the work
of <i>santero</i> Rafael Aragon, active from 1829 to after 1855.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_67" id="Ref_67" href="#Foot_67">[67]</a></span>
Symbolic of man's physical suffering, the image of the <i>Jesus
Nazareno</i> is essential to <i>penitente</i> enactments of the
Passion.</p>

<p>On the left side of the east <i>morada</i> altar, two carved images
represent the grieving mother of Jesus as "Our Lady of Sorrows"
(<i>Nuestra Señora de los Dolores</i>), one image (Figure 39) in pink
equipped with her attribute, a dagger; the other (Figure 40), like
many processional figures, has been constructed by draping a pyramidal
frame of four sticks with gesso-dipped cloth,
which, when dry, is painted to represent a skirt. The
apron-like design that appears on the skirt, now hidden
under a black dress, indicates that the original identity
probably was "Our Lady of Solitude" (<i>Nuestra Señora
de la Soledad</i>).<span

<p>Also on the left side of the east <i>morada</i> altar, there are two
male saints (<i>santos</i>) who fill vital roles in the
<i>penitente</i> Easter drama. One, St. Peter (San Pedro) with the
cock (Figure 41), is a <i>bulto</i> whose frame construction
duplicates that of Our Lady (Figure 40). The cock apparently was made
by another hand, and, despite its replaced tail, is a fine expression
of local art. This group represents Peter's triple denial of Jesus
before the cock announced dawn of the day of the Crucifixion. The
<i>bulto</i> of San Pedro has special meaning for <i>penitentes</i>
who, through their penance, bear witness to "Jesus the Nazarene."</p>

<p>With the other <i>bulto</i>, <i>penitentes</i> have also recalled the
crucifixion by representing St. John the Evangelist (San Juan) at the
foot of the cross, where Jesus charged the disciple with the care of
His mother. The image of John (Figure 42) bears distinctive stylistic
features: blunt fingers; protruding forehead, cheek bones, and chin;
and a full-lipped, open mouth.</p>

probably this figure of St. John (Figure 42) now resting in the east
<i>morada</i>. She has reported that this image and that of St. Peter
were in the mission of Santo Tomás before 1919.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_70" id="Ref_70" href="#Foot_70">[70]</a></span>
The shift in residence for these <i>santos</i> was substantiated by José Espinosa,
who stated that several images "were removed to one of the local
<i>moradas</i> ... when the old church was torn down."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_71" id="Ref_71" href="#Foot_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>On the right side of the east <i>morada</i> altar, images of two male
saints reflect the intense affection felt by <i>penitentes</i> for the
Franciscan saints Anthony of Padua and John of Nepomuk. The most
popular New Mexican
saint, San Antonio (Figure 43), customarily carries
the young Jesus, <i>El Santo Niño</i>. This image has been
painted dark blue to represent the traditional Franciscan
habit of New Mexico before the 1890s.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_72" id="Ref_72" href="#Foot_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The 14th-century saint, John of Nepomuk, Bohemia (Figure 44), is known
from a legend that states he was killed by King Wenceslaus for
refusing to reveal secrets of the Queen, for whom he was confessor.
The story notes that, after torture, John was drowned in the Moldau
River, but that his body floated all night and, in the morning, was
taken to the Church of the Holy Cross of the Penitents in Prague.
After the martyred chaplain was canonized in 1729, his cult spread to
Rome, then Spain, and, by 1800, into New Mexico.</p>

<p>Among the <i>Hispanos</i>, local Franciscans promoted this cult of St.
John as a prognosticator and as a respecter of secrecy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_73" id="Ref_73" href="#Foot_73">[73]</a></span>
Due in part to this promotion, <i>San Juan Nepomuceno</i> became a favorite
of New Mexican <i>penitentes</i>. E. Boyd suggests that the image of
St. John (Figure 44) may have first represented St. Francis or St.
Joseph. She also notes a stylistically similar <i>bulto</i> of St.
Joseph in Colorado Springs, manufactured not long after 1825.<span

<p class="gap-above"><span class="smcap">Oratory in South Morada.</span>&mdash;Turning to the south <i>morada</i>
chapel, we find numerous parallels to the earlier east <i>morada</i>
in <i>santo</i> identities and in religious artifacts. (Figure 10
presents a previously unphotographed view of this active
<i>penitente</i> chapel with its fully equipped altar.) The walls of
the west chamber of the south <i>morada</i> are lined with benches
over which hang religious prints in frames of commercial plaster and
local tin work (Figure 45).</p>

<p>The tin frame for a lithograph of St. Peter reveals repoussé designs
found on east <i>morada</i> frames (Figure 30, center). Other examples
of local tinwork are seen in Figure 46. On the right is a cross of
punched tinwork with pomegranate ends and corner fillers that reflect
Moorish characteristics in Spanish arts known as <i>mudéjar</i>. The
frame dates from after 1850, as indicated by glass panes painted with
floral patterns suggesting Victorian wallpaper. To the left is a niche
made of six glass panels painted with wavy lines and an early
19th-century woodcut of the Holy Child of Atocha.
Here again, twisted half-columns repeat a motif seen
on a tin frame in the east <i>morada</i> chapel. In front of
the draped entry to the south <i>morada</i> sanctuary stand
two candelabra, one of which is shown in the doorway
to the oratory (Figure 47) with tin reflectors and
hand-carved sockets.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_75" id="Ref_75" href="#Foot_75">[75]</a></span>
There are also vigil light boxes,
kerosene lanterns with varnished tin shades, commercial
religious images and ornaments that are similar to
items in the east <i>morada</i> sanctuary.</p>

<p>Embroidered textiles portray the Last Supper, and a chapter banner,
made up for the brotherhood after 1925, shows the Crucifixion in oil
colors. This banner bears the words "Fraternidad Piadosa D[e]
N[uestro] P[adre] J[esus] D[e] Nazareno, Sección No. 12, Abiquiú, New
Mexico." The title <i>fraternidad</i> is that assumed by
<i>penitente</i> chapters that incorporated in New Mexico around 1930,
although the term <i>cofradía</i> often appears in transfers of
private land to <i>penitente</i> organizations.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_76" id="Ref_76" href="#Foot_76">[76]</a></span>
A second banner, this one on the left, reads "Sociedad de la Sagrada Familia," which is
a Catholic women's organization that often supports <i>penitente</i>
groups.</p>

<p>In the oratory of the south <i>morada</i>, locally made images merit
special notice. Two carved images flank the entry to the south
<i>morada</i> sanctuary. The <i>bulto</i> on the right, St. Francis of
Assisi (Figure 48), has a special significance. As we noted in the
east <i>morada</i>, many Spanish settlers in New Mexico honored San
Francisco as the founder of the Franciscans, the order whose
missionaries long had served the region. The second <i>bulto</i>
(Figure 49) reveals clues that it originally had been a representation
of the Immaculate Conception (<i>Inmaculata Concepción</i>). In
Abiquiú, however, this figure is called <i>la mujer de San Juan</i>
("the woman of St. John"), a phrase that indicates the major role Mary
holds for the <i>penitentes</i>. With this image they refer to the
moment in the Crucifixion when Jesus committed the care of His mother
to St. John. As introductions to the south <i>morada</i> chancel, St.
Francis and the Marian image are excellent specimens of pre-1850
<i>santero</i> craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Two more images of Mary occur on the altar of the south <i>morada</i>
sanctuary. The first (Figure 50) takes its proper ecclesiastic
position on the Gospel side, to the viewer's left of the crucifix. The
second "Marian"
image (Figure 51) is less orthodox. Not only does this
<i>bulto</i> stand on the Epistle side of the crucifix but, like
the Marian advocation cited above as <i>la mujer de San
Juan</i>, this figure's identity has been changed to suit
local taste. <i>Penitentes</i> at Abiquiú refer to the image as
Santa Rosa, the traditional patroness of the area following
its first settlement by Spaniards.</p>

<p>Between these Marian images there are two large <i>bultos</i> that are
examples of the work of the "Abiquiú <i>morada santero</i>" suggested
earlier. Both are figures of Jesus. The first, a <i>Cristo</i> (Figure 52),
is the central crucifix on the altar. As in the east <i>morada</i>,
the focal image is accompanied by an <i>angelito</i>, this time with
tin wings.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_77" id="Ref_77" href="#Foot_77">[77]</a></span>
To the right stands the other image of Jesus, the
Nazarene, <i>Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno</i> (Figure 53). Along with
the nearby crucifix (Figure 52) and the figure of St. John the
Evangelist (Figure 42) in the east <i>morada</i>, this representation
of the scourged Jesus reflects the style of the "Abiquiú <i>morada
santero</i>." This Nazarene <i>bulto</i> embodies the <i>penitente</i>
concept of Jesus as a Man of suffering Who must be followed.</p>

<p>The special character of the <i>penitente</i> brotherhood is
demonstrated also in the last two <i>bultos</i> on the south
<i>morada</i> altar. The prominent size and position of St. John of
Nepomuk (Figure 54) on the altar indicate again the importance given
by the <i>penitentes</i> to San Juan as a keeper of secrets. The other
figure is the south <i>morada</i>'s personification of death (Figure
55), <i>la muerte</i>, here even more gaunt than the image in the east
<i>morada</i>. Probably made after 1900, this figure demonstrates the
persistent artistic and religious heritage of <i>Hispano</i> culture.</p>

<span class="smcap">Henderson</span>, p. 51, describes the <i>angelito</i>, in the
dim light of the <i>morada</i> ceremony, as a "dove like a wasp."
Another angel figure was given me through Regino Salazar by one of the
<i>penitente</i> brothers of Abiquiú. According to E. Boyd, it appears
to be the work of José Rafael Aragon, who worked in the Santa Cruz
area after 1825.</p>

<h2><i>Summary</i></h2>

<p class="nodent">The two Abiquiú <i>moradas</i> are clearly parallel in their
architectural design (including the constricted chancels), in their
artifacts&mdash;especially <i>bulto</i> identities such as Jesus
(<i>Cristo</i>, <i>Nazareno</i>, <i>Ecce Homo</i>, <i>Santo Niño de
Atocha</i>), Mary (<i>Dolores</i>, <i>Immaculata Concepción</i>,
<i>Soledad</i>, <i>Guadalupe</i>), Saint John of Nepomuk, Saint Peter,
and death&mdash;and lastly, in the ceremonies held
in the buildings, which link rather than separate the
<i>penitente</i> movement and the common social values of
<i>Hispano</i> culture.</p>

<p>Edmonson uses six institutional values to define <i>Hispano</i>
culture.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_78" id="Ref_78" href="#Foot_78">[78]</a></span>
All six can be found in the <i>penitente</i> brotherhood.
"Paternalism" is found in the relation of the members-at-large to the
officers and of all the <i>penitente</i> brothers to <i>Nuestro Padre
Jesus</i>, "Our Father Jesus." "Familism" is reflected in the
structure of the <i>penitente</i> organization and especially in the
extension of its social benefits to the entire community. "Dramatism"
is an essential ingredient of <i>penitente</i> ceremonies such as the
<i>tinieblas</i>. "Personalism" is revealed in the immediate and
individual participation of all
members in <i>penitente</i> activities. "Fatalism" is the focus
of Holy Week and of funerals and is personified by the
<i>muerte</i> figure in each <i>morada</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, Edmonson cited "traditionalism" as definitive of
<i>Hispano</i> culture, a characteristic that is clearly evident in
the <i>penitente</i> forms of shelter, ceremonies, and artifacts.
These commonplace objects and activities had been established at
Abiquiú before and during the period of <i>morada</i> building and
furnishing. Literary and pictorial documents presented in this study
of Abiquiú and the <i>penitente moradas</i> reveal that their physical
structure, furnishings, membership, and the brotherhood itself are
related intimately to, and drawn from, the traditional and persistent
Hispanic culture of New Mexico.</p>
